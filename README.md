### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

The pipeline, as discussed in the earlier lessons, consisted of doing for each frame grayscaling, Gaussian blur, Canny edge detection, masking, and the Hough transform.

The newest challenge is to identify and draw single left and right lanes. My process was done in several steps:
1. 

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:
